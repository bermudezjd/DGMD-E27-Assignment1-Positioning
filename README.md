# DGMD-E27-Assignment1-Positioning
Create a single web page demonstrating the following parts and pieces: 
1. A header containing site identity. The header should span the 3 columns mentioned below. 
2. A navigation bar that doesn’t scroll off the screen. This bar should be located underneath the header and oriented horizontally, spanning 3 columns, as described below. It should contain 5-6 primary links (no secondary navigation). The links may be dummy links – don’t feel the need to link to pages on the web or make pages for the links to visit. 
3. A three-column layout, with the primary focus of the page in the middle, plus a left and right sidebar. 
4. A footer containing a copyright statement. The footer should span 3 columns. 
5. There should be two images located within the primary content of the web page and one image in one sidebar. (You may have more images if you desire; this is a minimum.) Two of the images in the primary content should be pushed to the right and/or left edge of the primary content area, with the content wrapping around them. 
6. The content of the web page may be “lorem ipsum”, Wikipedia content, or the equivalent. The images may be derived from placehold.it, placekitten.com, or similar sites. You are welcome to write your own content and/or use your own images if you prefer. The content of this web page should be long enough that some scrolling is required at screen heights greater than 760px.
7. Do not use JavaScript, jQuery, or other scripting languages. Please use only HTML and CSS to complete this exercise.
8. Keep classes and IDs to an absolute minimum. You should be able to complete this assignment using selectors discussed during this week. Do not use more than 1 ID or 2 classes in this assignment. 
9. Use HTML5, including semantic markup. The web page layout should work in one browser/operating system combination: Mac/Firefox, Mac/Chrome, PC/Firefox, PC/Chrome. Other browser compatibility is not required. Specify your browser combination when you turn the assignment in. 
10. Post the web page and CSS file to your web hosting space. Submit the URL in the assignment dropbox. 
11. You may use the standard CSS box model or the border-box model, your choice.
